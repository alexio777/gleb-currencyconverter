| "src" is the base directory
    | "converter" is the main directory (app) for currency converter logic

           * if we need to add some extra logic
           (for example not only convert but get all exchange rates / see history of exchange rates)
           we can add new directory (app) with same structure

        | "services" is the directory to separate business logic
            | "enums" - is the directory to keep all enums

                 * to make app more scalable we can add enum modules to this directory

            | "conversion" is the example of business logic module
            | "validators" is utils for business logic (it can (should) be a directory same as enum with diff modules inside)
            | "exceptions" is exceptions for business logic (it can (should) be a directory same as enum with diff modules inside)

        | "config" - separate settings from base settings

            * good practice to create different configs(settings) for different mini-apps

        | "dependencies" - regular module to keep dependencies
        | "router" - main module with endpoints

            * should be small module without business logic inside

        | "schemas" - regular module to keep schemas

            * No need actually here - just to keep the structure.

        | "utils" - non-business logic module


Each new mini-app should have approx same structure so the whole app will be scalable.
